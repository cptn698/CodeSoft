# CC Fraud Detection

This repository implements a credit fraud detection system using machine learning models. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and Streamlit deployment for an interactive UI.




## PreProcessing

Data Collection and Exploration:-                
Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and distribution.
Visualize the data to identify patterns and anomalies.

Data Preprocessing:-        
Handle missing values and address imbalanced classes.
Standardize the features to ensure consistent scaling
## Feature Engineering

Feature Selection using Genetic Algorithm:-          
Implement a genetic algorithm to select the most relevant features for the model.       
Enhance model performance by reducing dimensionality and focusing on significant features.
## Model

 Model Training and Evaluation:-       
Train multiple machine learning models Decision Tree Classifier.

Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to select the best-performing model.

## Project 1: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Overview:
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. We explore various classification algorithms to identify patterns in transaction data.

Dataset: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset
Techniques: Data balancing (SMOTE), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Key Results:
Achieved 99.3% accuracy using a Random Forest model.
Precision and recall optimized to handle class imbalance.
## Project 2: Customer Churn Detection
Overview:
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn for a telecom company using historical customer data.

Dataset: Telco Customer Churn Dataset
Techniques: Feature engineering, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.
Key Results:
Achieved 85% accuracy using a Decision Tree model.
The most important features were tenure, contract type, and monthly charges.
## Project 3: SMS Spam Detection
Overview:
This project focuses on detecting spam messages in SMS datasets using natural language processing (NLP).

Dataset: UCI SMS Spam Collection Dataset
Techniques: Text preprocessing (TF-IDF), Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Key Results:
Achieved 98% accuracy using a Naive Bayes classifier.
Optimized feature extraction through text vectorization.
